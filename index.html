    <h1> HOW A COUNTRY'S LIVING STANDARD AFFECTS ITS DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <p> The living standards in a country refer to the overall quality <br />
        of life enjoyed by its residents. This concept is influenced by a <br />
        wide range of factors, including economic, social, <br />
        and environmental conditions. It is believed that there is a <br />
        strong and reciprocal relationship between living standards and <br />
        the development of a nation.</p>
